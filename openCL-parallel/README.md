====================

The source code includes a sequential and (partially) parallel implementation of Bor≈Øvka's MST Algorithm in OpenCL.

Folder(s) / File(s) included
----------------------------
OpenCL  Tutorial.pdf:	OpenCL Installation Guide.

CL:			Includes all the header files for OpenCL. While following
			OpenCL Installation Guide, skip step #6 and just run the
			the command,
			  sudo cp /path-to-CL-folder /usr/include/
			  (Note: You need to specify a valid path where CL folder reside)

code:			This folder includes sequential and parallel code.

code/sequential/mst.cpp:   Implementation of sequential program

code/parallel/CL:          It's a local copy of the similar CL folder mentioned above.

code/parallel/pmst.cpp:    Implentation of parallel program

Commands to run Sequential Code
-------------------------------
1. g++ filename.cpp -o filename
2. ./filename

Commands to run OpenCL Code
---------------------------
1. g++ -c -Wall -I /usr/include/CL/ filename.cpp -o filename.o
2. g++ filename.o -o filename -L /usr/lib/OpenCL/ -l OpenCL   (for 32-bit)
   g++ filename.o -o filename -L /usr/lib64/OpenCL/ -l OpenCL (for 64-bit)
3. ./filename
